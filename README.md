### Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Movie Reviews - Project Overview

- **Objective**: Leverage advanced NLP techniques and deep learning models (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN-LSTM) to perform sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews, classifying them into positive or negative sentiments.

- **Pretrained Word Embeddings**: Utilize Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings to understand semantic relationships between words, enhancing model performance.

- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the dataset to clean and normalize text, followed by splitting into training and testing sets. Determine optimal review length for model input.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implement and compare different deep learning models, using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves as evaluation metrics. Word2Vec with Bidirectional LSTM achieved the best performance.

- **Results and Conclusion**: Present detailed results, including model accuracies and the effectiveness of word embeddings in sentiment analysis. Discuss insights and potential improvements for future work.

- **Future Work**: Suggest directions for further enhancing the sentiment analysis model, such as exploring more complex models, additional datasets, or domain-specific adaptations.
